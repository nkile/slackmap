				-Slackmap-

An automatic Nmap scanning script for scheduled reports to Slack.

Dependencies: nmap, xsltproc

How it works: Slackmap (nmapscan.sh) takes an nmap scan and creates both 
a difference text file, based on a previous scan (if present) using 
ndiff and a pair of full scan .xml files. The ndiff text file is piped 
via 'cat' to 'slacktee.sh' to create a summary post on Slack. The full 
scan .xml is converted to a .html using 'xsltproc.' The .html is first 
piped to 'grep' to fixed a .html formatting issue then piped to 
slacktree.sh to be uploaded to Slack.
